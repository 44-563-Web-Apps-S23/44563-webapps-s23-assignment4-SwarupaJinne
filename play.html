<h6> THE LAST STRAW BY BOSWORTH CROCKER </h6>
<p>
    MRS. BAUER. No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. [_She listens through the
transmitter.] Thank you, Mrs. Mohler. [_Another pause.] I'll tell him
just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.
</p>
<br>
<p>
[MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into
 basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
 BAUER'S door and looks in.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    LANE. Say--where's the boss?
</p>
<br>
<p>
    MRS. BAUER. He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?
</p>
<br>
<p>
    [He stands looking at her with growing sympathy.
</p>
<br>
<p> 
    LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
    groceries for Sawyers.
</p>
<br>
<p>    
    MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
    which hangs beside the door._] Here.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    LANE. What's the matter?
</p>
<br>
<p>
    MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?
</p>
<br>
<p>
    LANE. [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.
